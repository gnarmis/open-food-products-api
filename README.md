# Open Food Products API

Powered by [postgrest](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest) (because I already cleaned up and put together a postgres database based on information from the BFDL database from USDA).

### Usage

1. Install Docker

2. Run `docker-compose up` to launch everything.

3. ... import the database

4. Now, you can visit http://localhost:3000 to see API docs.
